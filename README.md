# Eat da-Burger

## Introduction
This is a full-stack restaurant application that allows users to order any burger and then enjoy it. Data is persisted in the database allowing users to interact with other submitted burgers. 

Key technologies used  Express, MySQL, Handlebars

## What the project does
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
